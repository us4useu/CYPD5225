      <Description>
 The Cypress Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) is a software enablement product released in a single integrated package supporting Cypress PSoC and Flexible Microcontroller (FM) MCU device series. The PDL version 3.0.1 supports PSoC 6 device series only. It integrates device header files, startup code, platform drivers, peripheral drivers, middleware, RTOS, and a set of code examples. The platform and peripheral drivers abstract the hardware functions into a set of easy-to-use APIs. The integrated middleware and RTOS provides high-level software solutions. The code examples demonstrate the solution usage, serve as the evaluation platform, and can be used as a project starting point for customers to start product prototyping and development. The PDL is a Software Development Kit (SDK) for customers so that you can focus your efforts on application development to differentiate your own products, rather than spending energy creating a software development platform.&lt;P&gt;
