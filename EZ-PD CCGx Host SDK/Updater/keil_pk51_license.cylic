<p>2. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF THE SOFTWARE.<br>
SEATS, INSTALLATION AND LICENCE KEYS: Your use
of the Software is limited to the specific number of Seats issued
to you by ARM. For each Seat, ARM will make a Licence Key available
to you to enable use of the Software, or certain components
or optional functionality in the Software, as applicable.
You shall only install and use the Software and Licence Keys
on computers, or virtual machines running on computers, which
are owned by you (or which are in your exclusive possession under
an equipment finance arrangement) and which are either;
(i) located at your premises; or (ii) portable computers
which shall remain in the possession and control of your
employees when outside such premises. Each Seat and Licence Key
shall be limited or locked to a single item of your personal
computer hardware (also known as host ID) on which the Seat or Licence Key
is initially installed, except where ARM may separately agree
to authorise the transfer (also known as re-hosting) of such Seat
or Licence Key to another host ID.</p>

<p>COPYING: You shall not use or copy the Software or Licence Keys except
as expressly authorised in this Licence. You may make one additional copy
of the delivered Software media or image for backup or archival purposes.</p>

<p>UPDATES AND UPGRADES: Upgrades and updates replace the earlier releases
of Software that you are upgrading or updating, and are not additional copies.
When you upgrade or update the Software, the Licence Key for such new release
replaces your existing Licence Key. Therefore, if you are receiving the Software
as an update or upgrade, you obtain no rights to, and shall not, install or use
this update or upgrade unless you have first ceased all use of, and deleted,
your Licence Key for the version of the Software that you are updating or upgrading.</p>

<p>PERMITTED USERS: The Software and Licence Keys shall be used only
by your employees, or by your bona fide sub-contractors for whose acts
and omissions you hereby agree to be responsible to ARM to the same extent
as those of your employees, and provided always that such sub-contractors;
(i) work only onsite at your premises; (ii) comply with the terms of this Licence;
(iii) are contractually obligated to use the Software and Licence Keys only
for your benefit, and (iv) agree to assign all their work product and any
rights they create therein in the supply of such work to you. Only the single individual,
company or other legal entity to whom ARM is supplying this Licence
may use the Software and Licence Keys. Except as provided in this clause,
you shall not allow third parties (including but not limited to any subsidiary,
parent or affiliated companies, or offsite contractors you may have)
to use the Software or Licence Keys unless ARM specifically agrees otherwise
with you on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>REMOTE USE: The Software and Licence Keys shall only be used onsite
at your premises, except when used offsite by an employee (but not a sub-contractor)
of yours, on a portable computer, in accordance with the &quot;SEATS, INSTALLATION AND LICENCE KEYS&quot;
paragraph above, as part of his or her normal work activities, and only for your benefit.</p>

<p>MULTIPLE VERSIONS: The media on which the Software resides
may contain more than one version of the Software, each of which
is compatible with a different operating system
(such as Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Red Hat Linux).
Each version may only be installed and used by you to the extent
that you have valid Seats and Licence Keys from ARM.
To the extent that certain components of the Software are identified
for use on a specific operating system, you are only licensed to use
such components to develop software applications for use with the
relevant operating system or future compatible versions of such operating system.</p>

<p>EVALUATION USE RESTRICTION: If your Licence Key is evaluation only,
or the Software is identified as an evaluation version (collectively &quot;Evaluation Software&quot;),
then notwithstanding anything else in this Licence, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE
OF THE SOFTWARE IS TECHNICALLY LIMITED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TECHNICAL
RESTRICTIONS IN RESPECT OF THE CODE IN WHICH IT SUPPORTS, COMPILES AND DEBUGS,
AS IDENTIFIED IN THE TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS DOCUMENT SET OUT AT

is permitted by applicable law you shall not reverse engineer,
decompile or disassemble any of the Software. If the Software
was provided to you in Europe you shall not reverse engineer,
decompile or disassemble any of the Software for the purposes of error correction.</p>

<p>BENCHMARKING: This licence does not prevent you from using the
Software for internal benchmarking purposes. However, you shall
treat any and all benchmarking data relating to the Software,
and any other results of your use or testing of the Software
which are indicative of its performance, efficacy, reliability or quality,
as confidential information and you shall not disclose such information
to any third party without the express written permission of ARM.</p>

<p>RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF LICENSED RIGHTS: The rights granted
to you under this Licence may not be assigned, sublicensed or otherwise
transferred by you to any third party without the prior written consent of ARM.
An assignment shall be deemed to include, without limitation;
(i) any transaction or series of transactions whereby a third party acquires,
directly or indirectly, the power to control the management and policies of you,
whether through the acquisition of voting securities, by contract or otherwise;
or (ii) the sale of more than fifty percent (50%) of your assets whether
in a single transaction or series of transactions.  You shall not rent
or lease the Software. You shall not share the Software with contractors
(except as provided in the &quot;PERMITTED USERS&quot; paragraph above)

for the Software, for the shorter period of;
(i) the term of your licence to the Software
(as specified by the Licence Key); and
(ii) one (1) year, commencing on the date of purchase.
The support will be provided on any version of the
Software components defined in your Seat which, at the date
of your support request, is either
(a)the current version made generally available by ARM, or
(b) the previous version made generally available by ARM at
some time during the previous ninety (90) days.</p>

<p>The support will be provided by telephone, email or
other written format designated by ARM, prioritised at ARMs discretion,
and may not be used as a substitute for training or as additional
resource for your programming projects. Maintenance will be provided in
the form of updates, upgrades and patch releases to the Software
as and when they are made generally available from ARM.</p>

<p>ARMs obligation under this Clause 3 is limited to
the provision of support and maintenance to you and ARM
is under no obligation to provide any support and maintenance
to any third parties under this Licence. If you purchase
support and maintenance for additional years it will be
provided pursuant to this Clause 3 and will be subject to
the terms and conditions of this Licence.</p>

<p>If; (i) you obtained the Software from an ARM
authorised reseller or other third party, or;
(ii) the Software was provided free of charge or it is
Evaluation Software, you are not entitled to any support
for the Software from ARM but ARM may, at its sole
discretion provide limited support to you.
The vendor of the Software may or may not offer support
to you for the Software. Please refer to the Technical Support
area of <a href=http://www.arm.com>http://www.arm.com</a>

(if applicable) other authorised support channels.</p>

<p>4. CONFIDENTIALITY.<br>
You acknowledge that the Software, Licence Keys,
and any benchmarking data and related information
mentioned in Clause 2 contain trade secrets and confidential material,
and you agree to maintain them in confidence and apply
security measures no less stringent than the measures which
you apply to protect your own like information, but not less
than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent their
unauthorised disclosure and use. Subject to any restrictions
imposed by applicable law, the period of confidentiality shall be indefinite.
You agree that you shall not use any such information other than
in normal use of the Software under the licences granted in this Licence.</p>

<p>5. LIMITED WARRANTIES.<br>
For the period of ninety (90) days from the date
of receipt by you of the Software, unless the Software
is Evaluation Software, ARM warrants to you that
(i) the media on which the Software is provided shall be
free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use; and
(ii) the Software will perform substantially in accordance
with its accompanying documentation (if any).
ARM's total liability and your exclusive remedy for breach
of these limited warranties shall be limited to ARM, at ARM's option;
(a) refunding the price paid by you for the Software; or
(b) replacing the defective Software; or
(c) using reasonable efforts to correct material, documented,
reproducible defects in the Software and delivering such
corrected Software to you. Any replacement Software will be warranted
for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is the longer.</p>

<p>EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED ABOVE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE
IS LICENSED &quot;AS IS&quot;, AND THAT ARM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR OTHER TERMS,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p>

<p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
IN NO EVENT SHALL ARM BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
(INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE WHETHER BASED ON A
CLAIM UNDER CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY,
EVEN IF ARM WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
 
<p>ARM does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or
personal injury arising from ARM's negligence or ARMs fraud and
because some jurisdictions do not permit the exclusion or limitation
of liability for consequential or incidental damages the above
limitation relating to liability for consequential damages may not apply to you.</p>

<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS LICENCE,
THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF ARM TO YOU IN AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS MADE
AGAINST ARM IN CONTRACT TORT OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS LICENCE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF;
(I) THE TOTAL OF SUMS PAID BY YOU TO ARM (IF ANY) FOR THIS LICENCE;
AND US$10,00. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM WILL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THE LIMIT.</p>
